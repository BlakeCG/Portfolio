      With these tips and tricks you should become more conssistent with your

    <p>
      This list will give you an idea of what you will learn
    </p>

      </ul>

    <h2>Basic Positioning and rotation</h2>

    <p>
      Rotation, to put it simply, is a system of strategic movement and
      positioning among a team where players continuously change positions to
      create opportunities on offense or defense. The main idea is simple: one
      player challenges the ball, then rotates away to collect boost or fill
      empty space on the field, while another moves up to follow-up that
      challenge. This thought process can be applied to (nearly) every game mode
      and can improve a team’s power, speed, and coordination. By utilizing
      rotation in matches, you will start to notice that your overall speed will
      increase, as you’ll always be in motion. Thus, you’ll have more momentum
      going into every challenge. With this, you can be quicker to the ball,
      saving your team many awkward situations on defense and creating them for
      your opponents on offense. You’ll also notice fewer double commitments and
      open nets if your team is rotating correctly, as there should always be
      one person on the ball and one person back.
    </p>

    <h2>Rotation in Standard (3v3)</h2>

    <p>
      Standard is the most common game mode in competitive Rocket League, so
      every player should know how to rotate effectively in 3v3 matches. Each
      player has a role to play wherever their position on the field. For the
      purposes of this guide, I will refer to players on a team as Player 1, 2,
      or 3.
    </p>

    <h2>Rotation concept</h2>

    <div class="textdata">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Player 1 is the player currently challenging the ball. That player is
          actively trying to win the ball from the defender, advance the ball,
          clear the ball, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Player 2 is the player supporting Player 1. This can be interpreted in
          several ways, so it’s a very versatile position. Player 2 could be
          positioning themselves for a pass, clearing or demoing a defender,
          waiting on the wall, or be playing other supportive roles that
          actively rely on the results of Player 1’s decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Player 3 is the player behind the play. They are covering space behind
          the ball in the event of a potential long ball or surprise shot by the
          opposing team. You can usually tell if you are Player 3 if you have
          vision of both of your teammates in front of you on the field,
          although this may not always be the case.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="tips">
      Tip : try to keep an eye on what's happening on the field by swiviling the
      camera around really quickly. (The swivel speed can be made faster or
      slower in the settings.)
    </div>

    <h2>Power shots</h2>

    <p>
      Power shots happen when you hit the ball with the maximum ammount of force
      to your current position. this leads to powerfull clears when on defense
      to releave the enemy teams pressure and shots fast enough to get past the
      defence of the opposing team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a video by SubParButInHD that goes into detail on how hitboxes
      work and how forces are applied to the hitboxes to get the best possible
      hits.

    <p>
      After watching this video it would be fun to put in into practice! Now
      what you can do is load up free play and try to get powershots! It can
      take some time to get used to certian hitboxes and timing, just stick to
      it and eventually it will be burned into muscle memory for you.

    <h2>Basic Defense</h2>

    <p>
      One way of winning a match is just to have outmatched defense that you can
      turn into offense. Score goals but don't let them score any on you. A good
      defender can block shots with little to no boost in certian situations. If
      you press and hold the jump button and hold it you jump higher than just
      tapping the button. Combo this with the second jump and you can reach the
      top of the net with just jumping and no boost. Try to also be on the goal
      line and on the opposing side of the play so it can give you the time you
      need to reach and react for the ball when it's heading to your net.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a video tutorial from kevpert that explains the details of how to
      defend your net.
